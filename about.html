            <h1>Marvel Studio</h1>
            <p>
                Marvel Studios, LLC (originally known as Marvel Films from 1993 to 1996) is an American film studio that
                is a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios, a division of The Walt Disney Company. Marvel Studios is known
                for the production of the <a href="movies.html" target="_self">Marvel Cinematic Universe films</a> – the
                highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $21.37 billion at the global box
                office.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In addition to Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel Studios has also been involved with production of other
                Marvel-character film franchises that have exceeded $1 billion in North American box office revenue: the
                X-Men and Spider-Man multi-film franchises. The Spider-Man franchise is licensed to Sony Pictures. Since
                2012, Marvel Studios' films are distributed theatrically by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, having
                previously been distributed by Paramount Pictures from 2008 to 2011. Universal Pictures distributed <a
                    href="movies.html" target="_self">The Incredible Hulk</a> (2008) and has the right of first refusal
                to distribute any future Hulk films produced by Marvel Studios, while Sony Pictures distributed
                Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and will distribute any future Spider-Man films produced in conjunction
                with Marvel Studios. Previously, the studio was a subsidiary of Marvel Entertainment until Disney
                reorganized the companies in August 2015.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Marvel Studios has released 22 films since 2008 within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from <a
                    href="movies.html" target="_self">Iron Man</a> (2008) to <a href="movies.html" target="_self">Avengers:
                Endgame</a> (2019). These films all share continuity with each other, along with the One-Shots produced
                by the studio and the television shows produced by Marvel Television.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In August 1996, Marvel created Marvel Studios, an incorporation of Marvel Films, due to the sale of New
                World Communications Group, Inc., Marvel's fellow Andrews Group subsidiary in film and television
                stations, to News Corporation/Fox. Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise
                money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold Toy Biz
                stocks, which Marvel had started and took public in February 1995. Toy Biz filed an offering of 7.5
                million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150
                million. Toy Biz sought to sell 1 million shares, and Marvel sought to sell 2.5 million shares.

            <h1>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h1>
            <p>
                The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a
                series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters that appear
                in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes comic books, short
                films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel
                Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and
                characters. Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only
                character to appear across all its different media.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first MCU film was <a href="movies.html" target="_self">Iron Man</a> (2008), which began the first
                phase of films culminating in the crossover film <a href="movies.html" target="_self">The Avengers</a>
                (2012). Phase Two began with a <a href="movies.html" target="_self">Iron Man 3</a> (2013) and concluded
                with <a href="movies.html" target="_self">Ant-Man</a> (2015). Phase Three began with <a
                    href="movies.html" target="_self">Captain America: Civil War</a> (2016) and is set to conclude with
                Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). The first three phases in the franchise are collectively known as "The
                Infinity Saga". Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Marvel's Agents of
                S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in the 2013–14 television season, followed by online streaming with Marvel's
                Daredevil on Netflix in 2015 and Marvel's Runaways on Hulu in 2017, and then to cable television with
                Marvel's Cloak & Dagger on Freeform in 2018. Marvel Television also produced the digital series Marvel's
                Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films and many of
                the television series, as well compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. The MCU
                also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, while Marvel Studios has also produced a series
                of direct-to-video short films and a viral marketing campaign for its films and the universe with the
                faux news program WHIH Newsfront.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The franchise has been commercially successful, though some critics have found that some of its films
                and television series have suffered in service of the wider universe. It has inspired other film and
                television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared
                universes. The MCU has also been the focus of other media, outside of the shared universe, including
                attractions at various Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, an attraction at Discovery Times Square, a
                Queensland Gallery of Modern Art exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple
                tie-in video games, and commercials.

                Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel
                Publishing, Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media. In
                2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company.

            <br>
            <p>
                Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Comics, and by the early 1950s had generally become known as Atlas
                Comics. The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other
                superhero titles created by Steve Ditko, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and many others. The Marvel brand had been
                used over the years, but solidified as the company's only brand within a couple of years.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor,
                Captain America, Wolverine, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye,
                Daredevil, the Silver Surfer, Nova and Deadpool, such teams as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic
                Four, the Midnight Sons, the Defenders, and the Guardians of the Galaxy, and supervillains including
                Doctor Doom, Thanos, Magneto, Ultron, Green Goblin, Red Skull, Loki, the Leader, Kang the Conqueror,
                Venom, Kingpin, Apocalypse, Annihilus, Dormammu and Galactus. Most of Marvel's fictional characters
                operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life
                places; many major characters are based in New York City.
